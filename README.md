# React Quiz App

## Overview

This is a **React Quiz Application** built using **TypeScript**, **React**, and an external API for fetching quiz questions. The application allows users to take a quiz with multiple-choice questions and track their performance.

The quiz pulls questions from an API and displays them in a random order, with shuffled answers for each question. Users can select their answers, and at the end of the quiz, they’ll receive a score.

## Features

- **Multiple quiz categories and difficulty levels**.
- **Shuffled answers** for each question to avoid guessing based on answer order.
- **Responsive UI** that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-time score tracking** as users progress through the quiz.
- **Uses environment variables** to hide API keys.

## Technologies Used

- **React** (for building the UI components)
- **TypeScript** (for static typing and better code quality)
- **React Router** (for routing, if used in the project)
- **Styled Components** (for styling the application)
- **Fetch API** (to make HTTP requests to get quiz data)
- **dotenv** (to manage sensitive API keys using environment variables)
